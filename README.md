## 💡 What is EtherCart?

**EtherCart** is a revolutionary Chrome extension and Progressive Web App (PWA) that brings **decentralized commerce directly to the websites you browse every day** — X, Reddit, Tiktok, Whatsapp, Instagram, Facebook marketplace blogs, forums, and beyond.

Imagine seeing a digital artwork on X, a guide on Reddit, or a music snippet on a blog — and being able to **buy it instantly with one click**, using **crypto or credit card**, without ever leaving the page.

That’s **EtherCart**: *eCommerce, reimagined for the decentralized web.*

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔹 Floating Store Widget
A sleek, non-intrusive widget appears on supported sites, showing live digital product listings with real-time ETH-to-fiat pricing.

> “I saw a generative art post on Reddit — clicked, paid in ETH, got the file in seconds.”  
> – *Lena, digital artist from Berlin*

### 🔹 Dual Payment Flow
- **Crypto?** Pay instantly via MetaMask or WalletConnect (Ethereum/Polygon).
- **No wallet?** Use Stripe — credit card, Apple Pay, Google Pay.
  
👉 **Everyone can buy. Everyone can sell.**

### 🔹 In-Page Commerce
No redirects. No sign-ups. Just **buy digital goods where they’re discovered** — right on the content page.

### 🔹 Seller Empowerment
Content creators can list digital items (eBooks, presets, NFTs, audio clips, code snippets) in seconds — with **zero platform fees** and full control over pricing and delivery.

### 🔹 Escrow Smart Contracts
All crypto transactions are secured by auditable Ethereum smart contracts. Funds are held in escrow and released only upon confirmed delivery.

### 🔹 Cross-Platform Sync
Start on the Chrome extension. Continue on the PWA. Manage sales, payouts, and inventory from any device.
